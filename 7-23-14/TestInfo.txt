TEST 1: compare calculated "generated" spectrum with spectrum actually produced by lights (same multipliers)
ideal multiplier: .01, sky_shaded.txt
RGBAW multipliers: 0.12037, 0.35208, 0.81796, 0.098766, 0.025159

TEST 2: choose multipliers and apply them to the actual light. Take the spectrum of the light and show that the optimizer
reproduces the exact multipliers when given the light.
RGBAW multipliers: .8, .6, .1, .2, .3
